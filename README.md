# Re3ModCreator
Changes various aspects of data within RDT files of RE3: Nemesis

Requires python 3.10 or later
Requires Pyqt5 (pip install PyQt5)

Currently the editor only changes items.  Mod verification isn't perfect, and doesn't check for whether you have key items to access certain items (for example, it doesn't check if you have the wrench for the firehose location item).  Red text is necessary items, yellow text is to address missing optional items or duplicates.

Some items don't appear in the editor for changing.. for example the balls and gold gear in the chronos room.  These items either don't take to changes or have special handling.  As I learn more, i may eventually get these implemented.
